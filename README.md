This repository provides the official public link to the project used in the study:

**“Wing-Based Identification of Dengue Vector Mosquitoes Using Convolutional Neural Networks.”**

All training, validation, and evaluation procedures were fully implemented on the **Edge Impulse platform**.
No code or configuration files are stored in this repository; instead, it serves as a reference entry point for accessing the complete public project, where all dataset information, preprocessing steps, model settings, and evaluation results are already available.

# 📁 Public Project Link

The full project, including dataset configuration, preprocessing blocks, feature extraction settings, classifier parameters, and evaluation results, is publicly available on Edge Impulse:

**Edge Impulse Project:** https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/793939/live

# 📄 About This Repository

This repository serves as a public reference accompanying the article:

**“Wing-Based Identification of Dengue Vector Mosquitoes Using Convolutional Neural Networks.”**

Because all experiments were conducted directly within the Edge Impulse platform, no additional code artifacts are provided here.

# 📚 How to Reproduce the Results

To reproduce the results, simply open the public project link above.
Edge Impulse provides:

Dataset samples and class distribution

Preprocessing and data augmentation configuration

Model architectures (MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet-B0)

Confusion matrices and per-class metrics

Export options for the trained models

No additional setup is required.
